 * testing without a webview.
 *
 * **tmux is never bundled.** A static build would mean a musl toolchain in the
 * CI builder image (which strands ~2 GB of layers on every runner that pulled
 * it), a bundled terminfo directory, a second sidecar in the macOS notarize
 * path, and a CVE cadence for a C dependency nothing here owns. The platform's
 * own package manager is the smaller, honest answer.
