Sidebar upgrade (rides the embedded SPA): recent sessions carry live status dots — working / idle / waiting-for-you / exited / ended / node-unreachable, one precedence shared with the home cards — and the rail sorts them live-first (waiting → working → idle → node-offline → exited → ended). A filter field searches all sessions; `+` buttons launch a subshell or open the new-workspace dialog, which now lets you pick existing sessions (multi-select) or launch one BEFORE the workspace exists. Sessions can be dragged from the sidebar straight into a workspace dock (adds a pane, focuses an existing one, never duplicates) or onto a workspace card. One SSE feed at the app root keeps every list current on every page.
